# Projects

This folder contains **active client projects** that you're currently working on. Each project should have a clear goal, deadline, and deliverables.

## What Goes Here

- Active client projects with defined scope and timeline
- Internal projects with specific outcomes (e.g., "Build new portfolio website")
- Short to medium-term initiatives with clear completion criteria

## What Doesn't Go Here

- Ongoing responsibilities (those go in **Areas**)
- Reference materials (those go in **Resources**)
- Completed projects (those go in **Archive**)

## Organization Structure

Create a folder for each project with:
- Project overview and goals
- Client information and contacts
- Scope of work and deliverables
- Timeline and milestones
- Meeting notes
- Progress updates
- Deliverable files

## Project Lifecycle

1. **Project Created** - New folder created from template
2. **In Progress** - Active work happening
3. **Review** - Client review phase
4. **Complete** - All deliverables approved
5. **Archived** - Moved to Archive folder

## Templates

Use the templates in `_templates/` folder:
- `project-kickoff.md` - Initial project setup
- `weekly-status.md` - Weekly progress updates
- `project-closeout.md` - Final project review

## Examples

```
1-Projects/
├── ACME-Website-Redesign/
├── TechCorp-API-Integration/
└── StartupXYZ-Mobile-App/
```

## Best Practices

- Keep project names descriptive and consistent
- Update project status regularly
- Link to relevant Areas and Resources
- Archive projects promptly when complete
- Track billable hours in each project folder
