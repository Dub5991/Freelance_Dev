# 📥 Inbox

## Purpose
Capture zone for all incoming information, ideas, and quick notes.

## What Goes Here
- Quick ideas and thoughts
- Meeting notes (before processing)
- Links to read later
- Screenshots and images
- Anything that needs to be processed later

## Workflow
1. **Capture** - Dump everything here quickly without thinking
2. **Process** - Weekly review to move items to appropriate folders:
   - Tasks → `03-Tasks/`
   - Projects → `04-Projects/`
   - Reference → `06-Resources/`
   - Client info → `05-Areas/People/` or `05-Areas/Companies/`

## Best Practices
- Keep this folder at **inbox zero** weekly
- Don't let items age more than 7 days
- Use descriptive filenames for quick scanning
- This is NOT a permanent storage location

## MCP Integration
- No direct MCP server integration
- Manual organization recommended for maximum flexibility
