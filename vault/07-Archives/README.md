# 🗄️ Archives

## Purpose
Completed projects, old clients, and historical data.

## What Goes Here
- Completed projects (from `04-Projects/`)
- Churned clients (from `05-Areas/Companies/`)
- Old quarterly goals (from `01-Quarter_Goals/`)
- Past proposals and contracts
- Anything inactive but worth keeping

## When to Archive
- **Projects**: When fully delivered and closed
- **Clients**: 6 months after contract ends (no renewal)
- **Goals**: After annual review
- **Tasks**: Never (keep for billing history)
- **Invoices**: Never (keep for tax/legal)

## Structure
Organize by year and category:
```

## Archive Process
1. **Review**: Ensure no outstanding items
2. **Document**: Add final notes, outcomes, lessons
3. **Move**: Relocate to appropriate archive folder
4. **Update**: Remove from active systems/dashboards

## Example Archived Project
```markdown
# [ARCHIVED] Project: Legacy Migration - OldClient Inc.

**Archived Date**: 2026-01-15  
**Reason**: Project completed, client contract ended

## Final Stats

- **Total Hours**: 180 hours
- **Revenue**: $27,000
- **Outcome**: Successfully migrated, client satisfied

## Lessons Learned

- Weekly check-ins kept project on track

```

## Retention Policy
- **Keep Forever**: Tax documents, invoices, contracts
- **Keep 7 Years**: Financial records (IRS requirement)
- **Keep 3 Years**: Project files, client communications
- **Keep 1 Year**: Meeting notes, weekly plans

## Search and Reference
Even archived, you can:
- Reference old project approaches
- Show portfolio examples
- Analyze past pricing/profitability
- Learn from successes and mistakes

## Best Practices
- Archive quarterly during reviews
- Don't delete, just move
- Maintain consistent folder structure
- Add context before archiving (don't just dump)
- Keep archives separate from active work

## MCP Integration
- No direct MCP server writes to archives
- Manually move files after MCP servers mark as inactive
- Keep archived client YAML files for historical revenue analysis
